            <p>
                Hey, I'm Or Ben Yair, a tech lover and my dream is to become a front end developer from Tel Aviv,
                Israel.
            </p>
            <p>
                I
                work as a tech
                support engineer at Remitly, where I help people send money online.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have fun working on projects and
                fixing bugs, and I'm always up for learning new things and getting better at what I do.
            </p>
            <p> I'm in the middle of
                a degree in computer science from the Open University of Israel, and I'm taking practical courses in
                front
                end
                development from Codecademy.</p>
            <p>
                When I'm not working, I like to do some sports, play PC games, and code some
                more.
            </p>
            <p>This is my portfolio website, where you can check out some of my work and get in touch with me.</p>
            <h4>I hope you will love my work...</h4>
